# Contributions
If you would like to write an article for the site or make a correction, please send a pull request. I would love to hear from you.

# Licence
I need to clarify the licence situation for the code and images.  However, the situation for the posts is a little clearer, to find out the licence for each post look at the article on-line and at the bottom you will see what licence it is under.  The YAML header also gives a clue to this.
