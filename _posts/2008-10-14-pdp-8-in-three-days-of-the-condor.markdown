I watched 'Three Days of the Condor' the other night and loved seeing what I believe is a Dec PDP 8/E being used.  Also featured in connection with this machine was a DecWriter, paper tape reader and possibly a VT-52 video terminal.

The film revolves around a CIA researcher, Robert Redford, finding out about a secret section within the CIA, and their attempts to silence him.

While the film itself is great, I was really pleased to spot the PDP 8, and was interested to see it doing OCR scanning.  I am told that it was indeed used for OCR scanning sometimes and there were even add on cards to improve the speed of this.  The computer isn't in the film for long, but it does show a computer operator unloading a Dectape, although things don't turn out well for her, as you can see from the final picture.
