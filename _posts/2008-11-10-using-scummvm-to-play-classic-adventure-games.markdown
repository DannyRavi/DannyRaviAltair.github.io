[ScummVM](http://www.scummvm.org) is Virtual Machine, that allows you to run adventure games created for a number of game creation engines.  This is a great way of playing those classic adventure games that you loved so much, or never got a chance to play at the time.  Some of them such as [Beneath a Steel Sky](/2008/11/13/beneath-a-steel-sky-my-favourite-graphical-adventure-game/ "Beneath a Steel Sky‚ My Favourite Graphical Adventure Game") have rarely been bettered and can provide hours of fun.

## Supported Game Creation Engines
The virtual machine supports a number of game engines, but the most well known are:

### SCUMM (Script Creation Utility for Maniac Mansion)
This, as the full name suggests, was written by Lucasfilm Games/LucasArts to make creating the game, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maniac_Mansion">Maniac Mansion</a>, on the Commodore 64 easier.   Because the game was created using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCUMM">SCUMM</a> engine, it made porting the game much simpler and hence found it's way to numerous platforms.  This engine and later versions of it were used for other classic adventure games such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zak_McKracken_and_the_Alien_Mindbenders">Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders</a>.

### AGI (Adventure Game Interpreter)
This was developed by Sierra online to create their early adventure games.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_Game_Interpreter">AGI</a> was best known for its use in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kings_Quest">Kings Quest</a>  and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Quest">Space Quest</a> series of games.

### Virtual Theatre
This engine was developed by <a href="http://www.revolution.co.uk/">Revolution Software</a> to create their new adventure games.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Theatre">Virtual Theatre</a> was used in a number of games including my favourite, Beneath a Steel Sky.

## Where Now?
I would begin by downloading Beneath a Steel Sky from the ScummVM <a href="http://www.scummvm.org/downloads.php">download</a> page.  This is probably one of the best games available for it, and it is free.  Hmm, have I mentioned Beneath a Steel Sky enough yet?  No I don't think so, why not take a look at my article: <a href="/2008/11/13/beneath-a-steel-sky-my-favourite-graphical-adventure-game/">Beneath a Steel Sky‚ My Favourite Graphical Adventure Game</a>.
