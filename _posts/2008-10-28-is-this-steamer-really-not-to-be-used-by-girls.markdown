I was preparing the walls of our nursery on the weekend, ready for the arrival of our first child in December.  I was about to start steaming off the border and thought I'd better look at the instructions on the steamer.  The only writing on the steamer is the label pictured below and I couldn't help but wonder: Was it really saying that the steamer wasn't to be used by girls?

<img src="/images/posts/steamer_nogirls.jpg" title="Label from the Steamer" alt="Picture of a label from a steamer that appears to be indicating that it should not be used by girls" />

Here is a picture of the label on the steamer.  I know people will say that in Germany it probably represents a child, but I don't know.  Maybe things really are different there.
